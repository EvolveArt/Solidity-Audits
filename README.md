Those Audits engage nothing and are purely here to inform users and train my solidity skills.
I take no responsability for any losses on a protocol I've audited.

I'll keep updating this repo with other audits regularly so leave a star if you wanna see more ⭐

This is part of a bigger thing you'll soon hear about so stay tuned 👀
